An API server with Django, Django Rest Framework 
(DRF), and JWT Authentication with the following 
functionality.

a. Using postman or test script to test endpoints.
b. Use a custom user (not Django’s base user model).
c. Incorporate multi-factor authentication (Can be email, Google Authenticator)

e. Write Logic (or use any libraries) to Track user logins, failed password attempts.
f. When password attempts exceed a certain threshold lock the account.
g. Provide account unlock facility.
h. Bonus: Write logic to detect multiple and simultaneous logins from same user.
HINT: Using 3ed Party libraries is allowed to get the task done. No need to write 
implement logic from scratch.
2. Submit a video of the working project.
3. Submit source code with proper readme to replicate and check your 
project (Bonus for Automated Tests).

PS: Majority of the code for the above task are public. This task tests the applicant’s ability to grasp new 
libraries working and integrating those libraries into Django projects. This task also tests the applicant’s 
knowledge and experience in documentation and authentication workflow, which are critical for our 
projects. 

After the submission of the project, if you are selected for next round of interview, your technical 
interview will be on your code. So, try to understand what you code..!
